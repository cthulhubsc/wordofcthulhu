The private sale and airdrop contract for Cthulhu Token BSC.

In order to guard our community and early investors from any possible harm (phishing, imitation of CTHL, scams) by third parties, we decided to use a different contract for private sale / airdrops. There is a ratio of 1 - 1000 between $WoC and $CTHL.

 **There will be three usage of $WoC contract:**

**1-** 
  When our early investors successfully participate in the Private Sale, **they will get $WoC instead of $CTHL.**
  After the Public Sale completed, before the pancakeswap listing, **they will recieve $CTHL tokens for the amount they invested in.**
 
  **For example:**
  Howard participated to $CTHL token private sale with the amount of $100. Since the private sale price of $CTHL is $0.00013, Howard should receive $100 / $0.00013 ~ 77000 $CTHL tokens, right?  Nope. He will recieve 77 $WoC token for the time being. After the Public Sale completed, **BEFORE** the pancakeswap listing, 77000 $CTHL tokens will be sent to Howard's wallet. And he get to keep his $WoC tokens too!
  
**2-** 
 **$WoC will be used to purchase and forge NFTs** on Cthulhu Token's Website when the NFT system is available later on.

  For example:
  Remember 77 $WoC tokens Howard keeps in his wallet? Great news Howard, you can use those tokens on the website to purchase / forge terrific Cthulhu NFTs.
  
  **3-**
   $WoC will be used as AirDrop token.
  
   For example:
   Phillips participated in a $CTHL AirDrop. And he got confused whenrecieved $WoC token. **SAME AS Howard**, he will get $CTHL Tokens for the $WoC tokens he keep and he can use them to purchase/forge NFTs too, **UNLIKE Howard**, he will get his $CTHL Tokens after the PancakeSwap listing.
